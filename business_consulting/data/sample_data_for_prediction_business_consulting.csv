As part of our ongoing digital transformation, we are undertaking a strategic initiative to standardise and document our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and policies across all departments. The objective is to create a comprehensive knowledge base that serves both internal and external users while also enabling the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with customer queries. To achieve this, we require a Business Analyst to work closely with department heads to ensure every process is accurately documented, optimised, and structured for seamless integration into an AI-powered support system.  Project Objectives The key objectives of this project include: Process Standardisation & Documentation o	Engaging with department heads to identify, map, and document all key business processes. o	Standardising workflows, ensuring clarity, efficiency, and compliance with best practices. o	Establishing a framework for SOP consistency across departments. Policy Development & Alignment o	Reviewing and refining existing policies to ensure they align with operational needs. o	Identifying gaps and drafting new policies where necessary. o	Ensuring policies are structured for accessibility and easy reference. Knowledge Base Development o	Structuring and categorising SOPs and policies into a centralised knowledge base. o	Ensuring content is optimised for both internal and external users, including employees, instructors, and customers. o	Implementing clear version control and review processes. Enabling AI-Powered Customer Support o	Formatting SOPs and policies in a way that enables integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). o	Ensuring information is structured to allow AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants to provide accurate and efficient customer support. o	Developing guidelines for maintaining and updating AI-training data based on SOP changes.  Departments to Cover The Business Analyst will work with key stakeholders across the following departments:  	Marketing   Documenting campaign workflows, digital engagement strategies, and lead management processes.

We believe that your experience with energy sources could prove an important part in moving this project forward, and securing a global 'first'. We do not have the resources to take it further.

Additional details It is clear from listening to the news and from the newspapers, that you, and your team, have great influence on the UK Government Energy Policy. Your advice is guiding the county towards its zero targets, as well and evaluating the cost and practicality of the recognised projects. With this in mind, we are approaching you for some advice and guidance, which we believe can make a significant contribution to the energy problem facing the UK and other countries. A small company has  invented  an energy cell which, based on the scientific definition, will generate electricity for forty years. The cell is scalable, and hence can power a mobile phone  forever  and provide batteries for applications ranging from appliances, drones complete housing requirements, and can be formatted to power a mini grid. The current situation is that although the R&D for the cell is complete, the move from unit manufacture to mass production requires substantial investment, and realistically it needs a large organisation to become involved and take the batteries to the world market. Please take a look at the published patent for the unique Platinum and Thorium battery on the IPO website (GB 2611740) and if you are interested, then please get back to us and we will enter into further discussions.
